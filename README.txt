The NoPassConfirm allows you to remove the password confirmation field on your buddypress registration page, 
in order to make it a little bit shorter and user friendly.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to increase your signup rate, by reducing the size of your registration form ? This plugin is for you :)

In fact, the shorter the form, the better it is. The NoPassConfirm (for buddypress) plugin removes the password confirmation 
field from the user registration page. Your user will not have to type their password twice.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if the user misstypes his password during registration? =
Simple: he will not be able to login, and will have to use the 'lost-my-password' feature.

= What about security? =
This plugin fills the password-confirmation field with the one provided by the user. This is done 
on the fly, there's no read or write from the database.
